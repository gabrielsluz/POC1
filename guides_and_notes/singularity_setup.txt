brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install vagrant-manager

mkdir singularity-vm
cd singularity-vm

vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize #Use this to increase the disk space

vagrant init sylabs/singularity-2.5-ubuntu-bionic64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

Vagrant modifications:
Create a vagrant machine with singularity installed, than alter the memory limit for it on the Vagrantfile by adding:
 config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "12054" #Change here
 end
 config.vm.synced_folder "datasets/", "/datasets"
 config.disksize.size = '32GB'
*Also create shared folder for datasets
*This did not help immediately, I had to reload the machine using vagrant
*This memory matter may become a problem
