Create a vagrant machine with singularity installed, than alter the memory limit for it on the Vagrantfile by adding:
 config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "1024" #Change here
 end
 config.vm.synced_folder "datasets/", "/datasets"
*Also create shared folder for datasets
*This did not help immediately, I had to reload the machine using vagrant
*This memory matter may become a problem
