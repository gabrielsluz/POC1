Important notes for training with a GPU remotely inside a Singularity container.

Container:
- Know how to stop the container
- Use a .simg container to run experiments
- Keep the container in image format in the home (network) folder
- It may be needed to bind the /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/ to a folder in the container

GPU usage:
- Always check if there is someone using the CPU or the GPU
- Use window multiplex to inspect the training
- Check if the GPU is being used corectly

Storage:
- Datasets must be kept in the storage. => '/srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/'
- Where to keep the results and best models ? => Storage seems a good option
- Which results => Prefer more than less, as the experiments are quite expensive. 
    - The model may be a must.
    - Validation and training errors



Testing GPU:
- Create a singularity container (may need to be cuda container)
- Put the teste_gpu.py in it
- Create /MNIST dir
- Bind the /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/ to /MNIST in the container
- Create the simg container
- Run it on the machine
- Test the command: nvidia-smi
- Test the teste_gpu.py, by running: python teste_gpu.py -- epochs 1
