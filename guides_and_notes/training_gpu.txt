-| Important notes for training with a GPU remotely inside a Singularity container.
Awesome tutorial: https://github.com/bdusell/singularity-tutorial

Container:
- Know how to stop the container
- Use a .simg container to run experiments
- Keep the container in image format in the home (network) folder
- It may be needed to bind the /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/ to a folder in the container
- Containers can only be created in specif servers and folders
- Only use sudo when needed.

GPU usage:
- Always check if there is someone using the CPU or the GPU
- Use window multiplex to inspect the training
- Check if the GPU is being used corectly

Storage:
- Datasets must be kept in the storage. => '/srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/'
- Where to keep the results and best models ? => Storage seems a good option
- Which results => Prefer more than less, as the experiments are quite expensive. 
    - The model may be a must.
    - Validation and training errors

GPU:
It is easy to use GPUs with Singularity
- Use a docker image from nvidia
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04
- Run the container with the --nv option

-| Testing GPU - Generating image on local computer
*Basically a container with the proper installation, but without the code or the datasets.
-In the machine which has singularity,
mkdir mnist_test
cd mnist_test
git clone https://github.com/gabrielsluz/POC1.git
sudo singularity build mnist_test.simg ./POC1/gpu_test/Singularity

-Get into the container
singularity shell -B /datasets/:/datasets/ mnist_test.simg 
python ./POC1/gpu_test/teste_gpu.py --epochs 1

-To test on a server: **Always check everything needed
scp to the server or just get the container to the server
ssh
git clone https://github.com/gabrielsluz/POC1.git
singularity shell -B /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/:/datasets/ --nv mnist_test.simg 
python3 ./POC1/gpu_test/teste_gpu.py --epochs 1






-| Testing GPU: *Not working
- Create a singularity container in echer or proc2 /srv/forge (may need to be cuda container):
sudo singularity build --sandbox mnist_test docker://python:3.6
sudo singularity shell --writable mnist_test/

- Put the teste_gpu.py in it and install requirements
git clone https://github.com/gabrielsluz/POC1.git
pip install -r ./POC1/gpu_test/requirements.txt

- Get out to not use sudo for innapropriate things
CNTRL-d 
singularity shell --writable mnist_test/

- Create /datasets dir
mkdir /datasets

- Bind the /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/ to /datasets in the container
CNTRL-d
sudo singularity shell -B /srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz:/datasets --writable mnist_test/

- Create the simg container: sudo singularity build my_ubuntu.simg my_container/
- Run it on the machine (Check everything you need to check to use the gpu)
- Test the command: nvidia-smi
- Test the teste_gpu.py, by running: python ./POC1/gpu_test/teste_gpu.py --epochs 1
