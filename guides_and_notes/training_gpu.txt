Important notes for training with a GPU remotely inside a Singularity container.

Container:
- Know how to stop the container
- Use a .simg container to run experiments

GPU usage:
- Always check if there is someone using the CPU or the GPU
- Use window multiplex to inspect the training
- Check if the GPU is being used corectly

Storage:
- Datasets must be kept in the storage. => '/srv/storage/datasets/gabrielsluz/'
- Where to keep the results and best models ? => Storage seems a good option
- Which results => Prefer more than less, as the experiments are quite expensive. 
    - The model may be a must.
    - Validation and training errors
